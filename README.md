Problem statement:

Online Marketplace for Farmers to sell groceries directly to Consumers. 

Abstract:

In the absence of a direct link with the consumers, the farmers are at the mercy of the middlemen who occupy the entire space between the production and the ultimate sale of the produce. This makes middlemen very powerful and the farmers often find themselves at a disadvantage despite being the producers. Our solution is to build an Online Marketplace for Farmers where they can sell groceries directly to their consumers with help of some manpower. This way both the Farmers and the Consumers are benefited. The consumers can access the marketplace through the website or the mobile app.
Features:
Simple design with easy navigation.
Easy search and easier check-outs
Immediate confirmation of receipt of orders.

Technology Used:

Vue js - Frontend framework for building Web Apps.
Flutter - Cross Platform framework for Mobile Apps.
